Self-study curriculum. 

This is intended to be a collection of resources for the topics that interest me. It's public just in case anyone else who shares similar interests might benefit from it. 

This isn't a "get job fast" roadmap. It is intended to be _extremely_ comprehensive and probably over-engineered for most people. If you're the sort of person who says "but employers don't care about x - " then this collection may not be the best choice for you. 

If you love learning, hopefully you will benefit from this aggregation.

- Digital Art
- Creative Writing

## General Principles to Follow
- Study daily for at least 2 minutes per topic according to the same general sequence and schedule (atomic habits).
- However, ideally study and practice should be 30-75 minutes. In practice, I don't find real life has much more than that in terms of consecutive empty space in a schedule. 
- Studying should be an automatic reflex, not something that you have to consciously think about on a regular basis. Decision fatigue must be avoided at all costs. 
- Nobody likes doing daily life maintenance or one-off todos -- they're boring and get in the way of long-term goals. Use [stable mucking to attack mosquito tasks](https://calnewport.com/the-stable-mucking-method-a-freestyle-approach-to-keeping-the-annoying-little-stuff-under-control/). 
- Rest is a biological imperative and does not need to be earned.
