# personal-curriculum
Self-study curriculum. 

This is intended to be a collection of resources for the topics that interest me. It's public because anyone is free to use the resources contained within. 

This isn't a "get job fast" roadmap. If you're the sort of person who says "but employers don't care about x - " then this collection is not for you. 

If you love learning, hopefully you will benefit from this aggregation.
